## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Again I use <code>display: flex</code> for the layout. I am happy that I am getting used to it. <code>display: flex</code> is useful in changing the layout from column to row when the browser turns into a desktop view. It's my first time using  <code>flex-direction: row-reverse</code>to switch the order of the image and the content.

```css
/*mobile*/
.card{
    width: 100%;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}

/*desktop*/
.card{
        flex-direction: row-reverse;
        align-items: center;
    }
```

- I also use <code><picture></code>for the first time. Thanks to @correlucas ' suggestion on my solution to [Product preview card component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/product-preview-card-component-GIjYF2QvD3), I learn a whole new tag. I find it more intuitive to switch images based on the width of the browser. (However, I am struggling with setting the images to the correct/responsive widthðŸ˜…)
```html
    <picture class="hero-image">
      <source media="(max-width:650px)" srcset="images/image-header-mobile.jpg">
      <img src="images/image-header-desktop.jpg" alt="workers smiling">
    </picture>
```

- I used <code>mix-blend-mode: multiply</code> to create the violet-ish overlay on the top of the image. I like it. It's a rather simple way to achieve a great effect. 

```css
img{
    mix-blend-mode:multiply;
    opacity: 0.7;
}

.hero-image{
    background-color: var(--soft-violet);
}
```
### Continued development
- When I re-szie the browser, some extra spaces will appear around the image. I am still figuring out how to get rid of them.


### Useful resources

- [Stats preview component with HTML & CSS | Frontend Mentor Challenge | Simple Coding Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaHdmJf_ld4&t=1168s) - In the tutorial, the author use the <code>mix-blend-mode</code> CSS property to blend the image with puprle shade in a easy way. 
- [https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/articles/10267398](https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/articles/10267398) - This is agreat article which helped me understand <code>display:flex</code> fast. I will play around with the mentioned properties more so that I can feel more comfortable use them.
